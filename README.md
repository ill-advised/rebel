# Welcome!

This is the official (albeit simple) repository for the Rebel Architecture. This is the _local_ part of Rebel.

> This does not include any of the online file credentials.

# File Directory

## .access.html

> .access.html will redirect within the folder of .rebel.html, and provides a view monitor service, although blocked out on this site.

> See .atlas.html for view monitor. 

## .chronos/.rebel.html

> .rebel.html is the "ringer". It's the file behind it all, and the whole thing wouldn't work without it. It functions using a username and password, although not in the traditional sense. It then rebuilds the webpage with an <iframe> for removal of history.

### Username and Password

> The username and password system is not a username and password system in the traditional sense. Username and password are taken as variables, then sent when the page reconstructs upon submit.

> username = xxx, password = yyy

> On submitting the form, the code will reconstruct the webpage with the link starting as https://xxx.foo.bar/yyy.html

## .atlas.html

> This page is the most simple of all of them. It monitors an active view counter hosted by another service. This **is not avaliable in most releases.**

> It does not grab IPS or any personal information that could be used against users.
